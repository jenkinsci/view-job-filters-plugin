<div>
Create smart views with exactly the jobs you want. Your smart views can automatically include or exclude jobs by using things like the SCM path or type, the job type, build statuses or trends or triggers, relevance to the logged-in user, email recipients, Maven configuration, job parameterization, and user permissions. Mix and match filters to narrow down to exactly what you want.
