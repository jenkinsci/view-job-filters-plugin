    </dd>
    <dt>Match Value:</dt>
    <dd>
        The job property to match. One of the following:
        <ul style="margin:0px">
            <li><i>Job name</i>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Name</i> of the job itself, e.g. 'job'</li>
                    <li><i>Full name</i> of the job including parent folders, e.g. 'folder/subfolder/job'</li>
                    <li><i>Display name</i> of the job, e.g. 'Job'</li>
                    <li><i>Full display name</i> of the job including parent folders, e.g. 'Folder » SubFolder » Job'
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><i>Job folder name</i>: the name of the job's parent folder
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Name</i> of the folder itself, e.g. 'subfolder'</li>
                    <li><i>Full name</i> of the folder including parent folders, e.g. 'folder/subfolder'</li>
                    <li><i>Display name</i> of the folder, e.g. 'SubFolder'</li>
                    <li><i>Full display name</i> of the folder including parent folders, e.g. 'Folder » SubFolder'</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><i>Job description</i></li>
            <li><i>Job SCM configuration</i>: matching by SCM is extremely useful if you have hundreds of jobs that need
                to be "auto organized", and are already organized under source control. (Currently matches against SVN,
                Git, and CVS paths/configuration)
            </li>
            <li><i>Email recipients</i>: matching by email is useful for organizing by "who cares about this job."</li>
            <li><i>Maven configuration</i>: use this to match against "what does this job do"</li>
            <li><i>Job schedule</i>: matches against the CRON pattern and any comments for Timer and SCM triggers.</li>
            <li><i>Node label expression</i>: matches against the Label Expression under the "Restrict where this
                project can be run" option.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>Match type:</dt>
    <dd>
        Whether to add or remove jobs from this view. There's two kinds of match types:<br>
        <ul style="margin-top:0px">
            <li>Include matched/unmatched: adds additional jobs to this view.</li>
            <li>Exclude matched/unmatched: removes jobs from this view that have been included by previous filters.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>
